    "# Introduction\n",
    "*   **Background of the problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Medical image analysis is vitally important in diagnosing diseases and predicting patient outcomes in general.  However, the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in this realm is often hindered by a lack of labeled data due to issues such as a need for the domain-specific knowledge required for labeling, patient privacy concerns, disease prevalence, and an incomplete understanding of rare or emerging diseases.  This is a challenge when applying deep learning techniques whose performance often relies on large annotated datasets.  Additionally, existing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning techniques often require significant computational resources, such as large batch sizes and extensive training times, to achieve maximum performance.  This oftentimes makes them impractical for many medical imaging applications where compute budgets are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Current state-of-the-art self-supervised models such as DINO and BYOL can perform well with limited labeled data, but they still require considerable computational resources.  DINO is a teacher and student network, where both the student and the teacher utilize a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture.  This state-of-the-art, self-supervised model performed comparatively well to its predecessors when trained on unlabeled data.  However, its performance is sometimes dwarfed by supervised models.  Developing a deep learning architecture which performs well with limited labeled data and limited computational resources, could lead to increased patient longevity and general health.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Paper explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The key idea proposed in the CASS paper [1] is to leverage both CNNs and Transformers simultaneously, in a self-supervised learning approach, in order to address the challenges of limited labeled data and high computational cost in medical image analysis.  Unlike existing self-supervised methods, which may use one of these architectures, CASS passes images through a CNN and Transformer in parallel to extract their representations.  These representations are then used to find cosine similarity loss.  The idea is that CNNs and Transformers have different strong suits and by training them in parallel they’re able to learn from one another.  CNNs are translation equivariant and better at capturing local details, while Transformers are better at modeling global context.  By contrasting the features extracted by each architecture, they are able to learn from one another and eventually capture a richer and more useful representation.\n",

    "  The authors demonstrate that CASS outperforms existing self-supervised methods, like DINO, in terms of F1 Score and Recall value by an average of 3.8% with 1% labeled data, 5.9% with 10% labeled data, and 10.13% with 100% labeled data [1].  It achieved this while requiring 69% less training time on average, compared to DINO.  CASS was also shown to be more robust to changes in batch size and training epochs, which is a key limitation in compute restricted environments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  CASS marks an important step towards making self-supervised deep learning models more widely accessible and practically useful for medical image analysis.  It has the potential to accelerate research on rare and emerging diseases where labeled data is scarce, thus advancing the field of computer-aided diagnosis and patient outcome prediction.\n",

    "# Scope of Reproducibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we aim to validate the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hypothesis 1:** CASS requires less training time than existing self-supervised models (DINO).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hypothesis 2:** CASS is more robust to changes in batch size and number of epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test these hypotheses, we will conduct the following experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **Training time comparison:** We will measure and compare the time required to train CASS and DINO on the same dataset.  We will be comparing our results to the DINO results presented in the paper   Unfortunately, our hardware will not exactly match what was used in the paper, so we will need to make a calculated estimation on what the expected difference would be given the differences between our hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   **Batch size ablation:** We will evaluate the performance change of CASS when pre-trained with different batch sizes on the same dataset.  We hope to test with batch sizes of 8, 16, and 32, though we may be limited by our hardware to do less.  We will measure the classification performance and compare results between the varying batch sizes.  The paper found that CASS actually performed better with smaller batch sizes and it will be interesting to see if this is reproduced in our own experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Pre-training epochs ablation:**  We will measure the effect of the number of pre-training epochs on the performance of CASS when trained on identical datasets.  Our goal is to pre-train with epochs of 50, 100, and 200.  As in experiment 2, we will measure the classification performance and compare results between the varying epoch ranges.  The authors found that there were diminishing returns on performance when increasing the epochs beyond 200, so we will focus our experiments on the lower epoch ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have less computational resources than the authors did and our experiments may be affected.  Because of this, we plan to be flexible in our work and will update our experiments accordingly.  \n",

    "We set up a local test environment to test whether our CASS implementation was capable of running successfully for a single epoch with a batch size of 16.  This was successful and a single epoch took about 30 minutes using a GPU with 22GB RAM.  After training for one epoch on the Brain MRI dataset, we achieved a Recall value of 0.3 which is only slightly better than a naive random baseline.  This was to be expected given the extremely limited training duration and only served as a sanity check that our implementation was functioning correctly.  We believe this is a strong indicator that this paper is reproducible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our next step is to scale up our training process and run the model for a sufficient number of epochs (50+) in order to meaningfully compare our results with those reported by the authors.  This is a potential challenge given that our GPU has less than half of the memory of the GPU used by the authors.  This will likely restrict our batch size to less than 20, which is not ideal.  To address this issue, we’re considering setting up a cloud environment with more powerful GPUs so that we can reduce the overall training time and use a larger batch size.  We will assess the feasibility and cost effectiveness of that option in the coming days and make a decision based on the available resources and time constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also plan to evaluate using other relevant metrics, like F1 score.  If time permits, we may extend our study to another dataset, that being the DermoFIT dataset which is a private, paid dataset.  We have applied for access and are still waiting for a decision.\n"
